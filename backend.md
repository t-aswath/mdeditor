The backend part of the application comprises of two separate parts to classify the backend in a modular manner, which are,

<details open>
<summary><b><i>An Express.js server:</i></b></summary>
    <br />
    The Express.js server is the main API of the application which handles the communication between the <i>client</i> (mobile application) and the <i>database</i>. It is primarily used in order to get the real-time data of the patients correlated to each and every doctor in a hospital, which is later used to analyze the trend for the purpose of predictive analysis.
    The server enables the following functionalities/actions.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Actions:</b>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>Make appointments for the patients with a doctor.</li>
        <li>Mark a patient as consulted.</li>
        <li>Recalculate the average waiting time of a patient after each consultancy.</li>
        <li>Get a list of available doctors within a given perimeter radius.</li>
        <li>Calculate the time to travel to reach each hospital from the users location.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<summary><b><i>A Flask server:</i></b></summary>
    <br />
    The Flask server exists as a proxy server, and handles any sort of communications with the <i>Machine Learning</i> models that are used by the application.
    <br />
    <br />
    The two models which are used for the purpose of,
    <ul>
        <li>Estimating the number of patients waiting in the queue.</li>
        <li>Suggesting if it is actually viable to make efforts to travel for the purpose of consulting with a doctor.</li>
    </ul>
    are loaded with the flask server, to which the necessary params are provided by the express server, whose corresponding output is again sent via the express server, back to the <i>client</i> (mobile application).
