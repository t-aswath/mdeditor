# Working

### Browser Plugin
#### Manifest V3
The Tusk Act 2 browser plugin is developed using Manifest V3, ensuring compatibility with modern browsers. This framework enhances performance, security, and privacy, making the plugin robust and efficient.

### Knowledge Base Creation
- **Domain-Based Indexing**: Data extracted from user-visited websites is indexed based on domains. This approach enables the plugin to build a comprehensive understanding of visited domains and their associated content, enhancing contextual responses.
- **Quantization**: Azureâ€™s quantization techniques, such as scalar or binary quantization, optimize the size of stored vectors, reducing memory usage while retaining critical information.

### RAG-Based Q&A Chatbot
The plugin incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that leverages the domain-indexed data to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. This system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced interaction and understanding.
