# Working

The primary goal of our project is to validate legal and regulatory compliance of documents against an established set of rules and laws. The project workflow can be divided into two main sections: **Knowledge Base Creation** and **RAG-Based Document Validation**. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each component:

### Knowledge Base Creation

To verify compliance, we first need a robust **Knowledge Base** containing all relevant rules, laws, and regulations.

1. **Input Documents**: Users provide documents that contain these rules and laws. The documents can either be in plain text format or scanned copies.
   
2. **Document Upload**: Users upload these documents via a React-based frontend interface. Upon submission, each document is securely stored in an **Azure Storage Account**.

3. **Text Extraction**: Azure’s **Document Intelligence** service is then invoked to extract text from the uploaded documents. This service supports text recognition from both typed and scanned documents, ensuring comprehensive data extraction.

4. **Ingestion into Knowledge Base**: After text extraction, users have the option to ingest this document into the Knowledge Base. 
   - **Embedding Creation**: The extracted text is converted into vector embeddings using the **Azure OpenAI model “text-embedding-3-large”**.
   - **Storage in Vector Database**: The resulting embeddings are stored in an **Azure Cognitive Search** vector store, creating a structured and searchable repository of compliance rules and regulations.

The knowledge base built through this process serves as the foundation for document validation in the next phase.

### RAG-Based Document Validation

To validate external documents against the Knowledge Base, we employ a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, ensuring a high level of accuracy and contextual understanding.

1. **Document Upload for Validation**: On a separate interface, users upload the document intended for compliance validation. Similar to the Knowledge Base setup, this document is stored in the Azure Storage Account and processed through **Azure Document Intelligence** for text extraction.

2. **Document Segmentation**: The extracted content is divided into manageable sections, enhancing analysis granularity.

3. **RAG Chain Execution**:
   - **Prompt Construction**: Using LangChain, we create a custom prompt template tailored for each section. The prompt contains:
      - **The document segment to be evaluated**.
      - **Contextual information** retrieved from the Knowledge Base by performing a vector search using **Azure Cognitive Search**.
      - **Previously validated content and its results**, if applicable, to strengthen the model’s decision-making.
   - **LLM Processing**: Each prompt is sent to the **Mistral 3B** language model, which evaluates the content for compliance based on the context provided. This method is called **Query Decomposition**, where each part of the document is processed separately and sequentially to ensure a thorough review.

4. **Result Aggregation and Storage**: The model’s responses for each segment are stored as individual records, capturing both the compliance outcome (legal or not) and the reasoning.

5. **Frontend Display**: The final results are presented to the user in the frontend, showing the compliance status of each document section, along with the reasons for the determination.

# Use Case

**TUSK** provides a powerful, AI-driven compliance solution designed for organizations that handle a high volume of legally sensitive or regulated documents. By ensuring documents adhere to all relevant rules, regulations, and standards, TUSK mitigates legal risks and boosts operational efficiency. Here are some practical use cases for TUSK:

1. **Corporate Compliance Checks**  
   Companies must frequently review internal documents, contracts, and policies to comply with ever-evolving legal standards. TUSK simplifies this process by automating compliance checks, enabling legal teams to validate documents efficiently and with a high degree of accuracy.

2. **Regulatory Audits**  
   Organizations in heavily regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare, and telecommunications) face frequent audits to ensure compliance with specific regulations. TUSK allows these companies to proactively assess documents and flag potential areas of non-compliance, ensuring they meet audit standards with ease.

3. **Contractual Agreements**  
   TUSK can assist in validating contracts, purchase agreements, or service level agreements (SLAs) by comparing each document’s clauses against regulatory standards. This reduces the risk of signing agreements that may later result in legal liabilities.

4. **Document Standardization Across Subsidiaries**  
   Large organizations with multiple subsidiaries often need to ensure consistency in compliance documents across all branches. TUSK provides a centralized platform to verify that each subsidiary's documents align with company-wide regulatory standards and best practices.

5. **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Due Diligence**  
   In M&A activities, organizations conduct due diligence to evaluate the legal standing and compliance of potential acquisitions. TUSK can streamline the evaluation process by analyzing the target company’s documents for adherence to regulatory standards, reducing legal and operational risks.

6. **Insurance Claims and Policy Verification**  
   Insurance companies must often verify the compliance of claims documents and policies with industry regulations. TUSK helps insurance firms automate these checks, ensuring policies meet legal standards and claims are accurately assessed against regulations.
